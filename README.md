# Data Visualization Dashboard

This project is a data visualization dashboard built with Flask, Pandas, and Plotly. It reads data from a CSV file and presents it in the form of interactive graphs and charts.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Vinays1402/DATA_VISUALIZATION_DASHBOARD.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd DATA_VISUALIZATION_DASHBOARD


3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # For Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate # For Windows

4. Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the Flask application:

    python app.py

6. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000` to view the data visualization dashboard.


## Usage

Once the application is running, you can explore the data visualization dashboard by clicking on the "Graph" or "Pie Chart" buttons. The graph chart displays the data in a bar chart format, while the pie chart provides a visual representation of the data in the form of a pie chart.
